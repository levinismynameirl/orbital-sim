# Orbital Simulator (ORS)
**Alpha Release**

This project is a web-based orbital simulator built with Flask, allowing users to input parameters and calculate key orbital mechanics values such as specific orbital energy and orbital period.

---

## Project Overview

The Orbital Simulator (ORS) is designed to help visualize and calculate orbital parameters based on classical physics formulas. It supports* input of mass, velocity, distance from the planetary center, and the planetary mass to compute values like specific orbital energy and orbital period.

This tool is primarily intended for educational use, simulation, and experimentation with orbital mechanics concepts.

**note that it is heavily simplified as only just basic data is requested and outputted. we are still developing this website*

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Windows / macOS / Linux (tested on Windows 10+)
- **Python version:** 3.12 (strictly recommended to ensure compatibility)
- **Package manager:** Conda (recommended to maintain isolated environments and dependency control)
- **Git:** For cloning the repository (optional if sharing files directly)
