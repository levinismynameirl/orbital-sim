# Orbital Simulator (ORS)
### Alpha Release

*This project is a web-based orbital simulator that runs entirely client-side in the browser. Users input parameters to calculate key orbital mechanics values such as specific orbital energy and orbital period — all calculations happen instantly with JavaScript.*

## Project Overview
The Orbital Simulator (ORS) helps visualize and calculate orbital parameters based on classical physics formulas. It accepts inputs like mass, velocity, distance from the planetary center, and planetary mass to compute specific orbital energy, orbital period, and more.

*Note: This is a heavily simplified educational tool. Calculations and physics assumptions are basic and intended for learning and experimentation. The site is static and fully client-side — no server or backend required.*

## Prerequisites
Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

Internet connection to load the static site (optional if hosted locally)

## Tech Stack
### Frontend Only
HTML5 — Markup language for structure

CSS3 — Styling and layout

JavaScript (vanilla) — Client-side logic and orbital calculations

### Backend
None — the app is fully static and runs in the browser

## NOTICE:
**This website is currently in active development. This is the first build release. Future versions WILL include a backend, feature enhanced functionality, and offer additional advanced tools. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue improving the Orbital Simulator!**
